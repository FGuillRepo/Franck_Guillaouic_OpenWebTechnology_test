Test for Open Web Technology

Instructions:

I'd like to assign you a little Android test as part of the recruitment process. 
It consists of a small application with 3 screens (from which you have to choose at least 2 to implement). 
Please use a GitHub repository to submit the result by latest Monday 18th of March.

Search screen:

Use a public REST API of your choice to retrieve and display elements in a list based on some keywords introduced by the user. 
The only condition is that each element must have at least one image to display in the list. 
The rest of the information displayed in each row is up to you.
You can use for example the Google Books API: https://developers.google.com/books

Detail screen:

When an element in the list is selected, a new screen is opened displaying more detailed information. At this moment, store the information of the item in a local SQLite database (using Room).

History screen:

When the user opens the history screen, display all the elements present in the database in a list. 
Selecting an element should open the same detail screen as before.
You can make any assumptions of anything that is not specified here. 
If you feel like it's too much work you can simplify it.

What's important:

​​Clean code and well formatted, keep it simple and don't over engineer it
Focus on quality and readability
Usage of well known libraries to solve common problems

What's not important:

​​The UI (chosen layout, colors, etc)
Not necessary to implement tests (but you can if you want to)

Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any question.
